### README

This repo was restarted in early 2023.

I used to have linux and windows configs which had symbolic links to my files.

I decided to update my vim and bashrc files along with a new tracking style. Having my $HOME be my repo directory, with a .gitignore file matching everything and adding files on a one-by-one basis.

Got the idea from Drew DeVault's [BlogPost](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html)
